## 📂 Projects

### Lifecycle Management System (Developed with ArcGIS)
- In collaboration with the City of Montreal, I developed the "Lifecycle Management" platform using ArcGIS. This comprehensive digital solution streamlines tree management, covering everything from inspection to task execution. It provides real-time traceability and enhances internal communication.

### Comparative Analysis and Spam Detection System
- I conducted an in-depth evaluation of various NLP techniques, including word2vec, Glove, FastText, and BERT, to identify the most effective approach for spam classification. I then developed a robust spam detection system, optimizing the chosen models and creating an interactive interface that allows users to input messages and receive real-time predictions on whether the messages are spam.

### Binary Classification System for Breast Cancer Detection
- I designed a binary classification system to differentiate between benign and malignant breast cancer, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction. This approach utilized advanced analysis techniques to improve classification accuracy, playing a crucial role in early cancer detection.
